I can provide packages for your favorite package manager, but I need help from someone who knows the format. Contact me via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/issues) if you want to help.

## Documentation

### PDFium API documentation

Please find the [documentation of the PDFium API on developers.foxit.com](https://developers.foxit.com/resources/pdf-sdk/c_api_reference_pdfium/index.html).

### How to use PDFium in a CMake project

1.  Unzip the downloaded package in a folder (e.g., `C:\Libraries\pdfium`)
2.  Set the environment variable `PDFium_DIR` to this folder (e.g., `C:\Libraries\pdfium`)
3.  In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add

        find_package(PDFium)

4.  Then link your executable with PDFium:

        target_link_libraries(my_exe pdfium)

5.  On Windows, make sure that `pdfium.dll` can be found by your executable (copy it on the same folder, or put it on the `PATH`).

### How to use JavaScript V8 enabled binaries

If you are using the V8-enabled binaries, additional initialization is required.
In your code, before using PDFium you have to call `FPDF_InitEmbeddedLibraries()`
from the additional header `fpdf_libs.h`, which is only available in V8 enabled
binaries.

The archive will contain a `res` folder which you have to distribute with your
application. On macOS, you should include this in your application bundle; for other
platforms, place it where your application binary will find it.

See the following example for usage:

```c++
#include "fpdf_libs.h"

...

// Determine the path to files in the res folder from the archive
const char* resPath = "<path to the res folder>";

// Initialize V8 and other embedded libraries
FPDF_InitEmbeddedLibraries(resPath);

// Make use of PDFium
FPDF_InitLibrary();
FPDF_DestroyLibrary();
```

### How to create macOS universal binary

To create a universal macOS binary containing both Intel and ARM code, download
both CPU versions and use the `mac_create_universal.sh` script to create a
universal archive.
